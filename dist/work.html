                    <p> "I enjoyed reading “How I turned $38,673 into $1,129,030 in Fourteen Weeks by Spread-Betting Oil! - The pivotal trading period started on 08 February 2019!” by Neil G. Van Luven, and I loved the title! I thought the author was highly organized as his book begins with a test to see if you have a good understanding of the financial terms, he is going to use describing how he accomplished in this true story. The author goes one step further in providing a quiz to ensure the terms are understood for the reader to get the most out of his remarkable story.</p>

<p>"The story is told in the third person, which I enjoyed since it tells the cold facts without emotion on how this large sum was earned in approximately 77 days.</p>

<p>"Throughout the beginning of this remarkable book, the author has cautionary warnings about only investing money you can afford to lose, especially when spread betting. He points out most spread betting fails.</p>
<p> "I liked the way the author gives a very detailed and step by step history of this extraordinary event and by the end of the book, I had a new understanding of financial markets, the high risks involved and the large rewards and large losses an investor can experience. This author had courage as well as protective built-in steps which are described in detail, which contributed highly to his success.</p>

      <p>If you wish to enter the trading world, you will need a very high determination and strict discipline to learn to become a successful trader; you will have to spend all your time dedicated and committed to staying on top of your art to be better than your competitors. You will have to choose either to learn and remain on your own, or to find the right people to teach you their secrets, but bear in mind that the learning curve is faster if you find the right people from which to learn. It will save you thousands and a lot of time unless you're a genius, but as a professional trader, I don't know many people like this on the trading floor.</p>
      <p>Neil's book is full of his trading experiences, and it describes what the reader needs to know - how his success arises. It explains how he became a successful trader after an amazing experience of life. It shows in detail his real trading story, and how he made so much money in an extremely short period - it's just impressive.</p>
      <p>It's not necessary to say much about it. I invite you to invest a little of your time in reading this book if you want to upgrade your trading level and become a more profitable trader.</p>
      <p>Enjoy it, as I did!</p>

       <p>I was sceptical when first I discovered this book on a recent trip to London. However, that was short-lived once I started to read it. I was mesmerized from the very beginning and had difficulty putting it down . Not only was it thoroughly entertaining but it all made sense. I also learned a great deal about a subject I thought I understood. I am going to start putting some of the concepts outlined in the book to my current trading. </p>
       <p>This was a thoroughly good read.</p>

     <p>I have always been interested in Spread-Betting but I never tried it with Oil. This book has taught me aspects that I had never known. I agree with the Author when he strongly advises that a trader should pick one product and learn all he can about it to become an expert in that product before trading in it. The book surprised me by containing the actual trading details of each trade. After studying the trades, it all became clear to me. I recommend this book to anyone intrigued by Commodities.</p>

    <p> Your book – My Secrets of Balance Sheet Optimization is amazing. I bought it on Kindle three months ago and I have already implemented some of the suggestions. Where I have done so my supervisors have been most impressed and it has resulted in a promotion which I received today. </p>
       <p>Thank you for writing this book.</p>

       <p>I read your book which I purchased on Kindle – My Secrets of Balance Sheet Optimization – and at first I thought it was going to be too high level for me to fully understand and to use some of the ideas. However on balance after re-reading it I am now actually using several of the concepts which have impressed my colleagues. </p>
       <p>I am now confident that it will lead to personal improvement and more salary for which I thank you.</p>

       <p>Your book 'Secrets of Balance Sheet Optimization' which I recently purchased on Kindle has given me a fresh excitement in my job as an Accountant to a large multi-national in the Oil & Gas Exploration field. I will definitely use many of the concepts contained in it and several of my colleagues are also enthralled by its contents and they too will utilize many of the ideas expressed in it. </p>
        <p>Needless to say I have become noticed by my senior management because I express several of the suggestions and they are now taking greater notice of me for which I have to thank you.</p>
