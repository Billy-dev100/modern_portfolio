                    "I enjoyed reading “How I turned $38,673 into $1,129,030 in Fourteen Weeks by Spread-Betting Oil! - The pivotal trading period started on 08 February 2019!” by Neil G. Van Luven, and I loved the title! I thought the author was highly organized as his book begins with a test to see if you have a good understanding of the financial terms, he is going to use describing how he accomplished in this true story. The author goes one step further in providing a quiz to ensure the terms are understood for the reader to get the most out of his remarkable story.</h3>



<h3 class="sm-heading">
  "The story is told in the third person, which I enjoyed since it tells the cold facts without emotion on how this large sum was earned in approximately 77 days.</h3>



<h3 class="sm-heading"> 
    "Throughout the beginning of this remarkable book, the author has cautionary warnings about only investing money you can afford to lose, especially when spread betting. He points out most spread betting fails.</h3>



<h3 class="sm-heading">
  "I liked the way the author gives a very detailed and step by step history of this extraordinary event and by the end of the book, I had a new understanding of financial markets, the high risks involved and the large rewards and large losses an investor can experience. This author had courage as well as protective built-in steps which are described in detail, which contributed highly to his success.
