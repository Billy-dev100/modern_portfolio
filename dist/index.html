Neil G Van Luven has authored 41 White Papers on Balance Sheet Optimisation and has written a book on the subject.
        </li>
        <li>
Neil's first Book - 'Secrets of Balance Sheet Optimization' was Published in May 2014.
        </li>

Amazon ranked it #17 out of their top 100 in its Business Analysis classification.

Neil's second book is on Spread-Betting Crude Oil, based on his experiences.
          </li>
        <li>
          It covers fourteen weeks from 23 November 2018 to 04 March 2019 when Neil transformed $38,673 into $1,129,030 by Spread-Betting Crude Oil, taking advantage of the maximum Leverage offered by the Brokerage firm he selected.
          </li>
        <li>
The success rate achieved was 92.6% of his Trades being profitable and only 7.4% resulting in losses by the number of Trades and 94.3% profitable with 5.7% losses by the monetary value of the Trades â€“ all using Leverage of 4% or 1:25!
          </li>
        <li>
          There were 94 Trades in total, during this fourteen-week period, of which 57 were 'BUY' Trades and 37 were 'SELL' Trades. These results illustrate Neil's unique skillset as an Oil Trader.
